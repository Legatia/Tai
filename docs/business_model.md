# Tai Business Model & Phased Rollout

## Core Philosophy
Instead of relying on ads from day one, we bootstrap through **interactive financial primitives** that create value for streamers, viewers, and the platform simultaneously.

**Token Strategy (MVP & Phase 1-2):** Use **SUI** for all economic activities. A **Points System** tracks user contributions for future token airdrop when we launch the native token at the end of Phase 2.

---

## 📊 Three-Phase Strategy

### Phase 1: Engagement Economy (Months 1-3)
**Goal:** Create viral loops without needing advertisers.

#### Features
1. **Native Tipping**
   - One-click payments (**SUI**)
   - On-stream alerts
   - No third-party services (BuyMeACoffee, etc.)

2. **Staking Tiers**
   - Unlock room creation privileges
   - Different tiers for audio/podcast/video streaming

3. **In-Room Prediction Markets** ⭐ *Revenue Engine*
   - Streamers create predictions: "Will I beat this boss?"
   - Viewers bet YES/NO with SUI
   - Winners take loser pool (minus platform fee)

4. **Points System**
   - Track all user activity on-chain
   - Convert to tokens during Phase 2 airdrop
   - Visible leaderboard drives engagement

#### Revenue Streams
| Source | Platform Cut | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Prediction Markets | **5%** of losing pool | Primary revenue driver |
| Tips | **0%** (bootstrapping) | Build goodwill, add fees later |
| Staking | **0%** | Just access control |

**Projected Revenue:** If 100 streamers run 10 predictions/day with avg $50 pools, platform earns **$250/day** = $7,500/month.

---

### Phase 2: Legitimacy & Depth (Months 4-9)
**Goal:** Add sophisticated features now that you have traction.

#### Features
1. **Ad System**
   - Escrow-based agreements
   - Node-verified delivery
   - Transparent on-chain records

2. **Equity NFTs (OG Certificates)** ⭐ *The Reveal*
   - Deploy silently in Phase 1
   - Accumulate revenue share from tips + predictions
   - **Announce in Phase 2:** "Early holders already earned $X"
   - Creates FOMO for future drops

3. **Bounty Board**
   - Fan-sponsored challenges
   - Optimistic Oracle verification

#### Revenue Streams
| Source | Platform Cut | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Ads | **5%** of agreement | Escrow fee |
| Equity NFT Minting | **10%** | One-time mint fee |
| Bounties | **5%** of pool | Challenge fee |
| Tips | **2%** (introduce gradually) | Now sustainable |

**Projected Revenue:** With ads, platform could earn **$50K+/month** at 1K active streamers.

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Primitives (Months 10+)
**Goal:** Introduce experimental features that competitors can't replicate.

#### Features
1. **Micropayments (Watch-to-Earn)**
   - Viewers earn passive income just by watching
   - Node-verified watch time
   - Creates retention loop

2. **Advanced Prediction Markets v2:**
   - **Stream Futures:** Long-term bets ("Will X hit 10K followers by Dec?")
   - **Rage Quit Insurance:** "Will streamer rage quit in 10 min?"

3. **Future Experimental Ideas:**
   - Refundable Subscriptions (Stake-to-Subscribe)
   - Channel Tokens (Streamer DAOs)
   - Clip Royalties

#### Revenue Streams
| Source | Platform Cut | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Stream Futures | **3%** of settlement | Lower fee, higher volume |
| Rage Quit Insurance | **5%** of pool | Same as predictions |
| Micropayments | **1%** settlement fee | Tiny cut, massive scale |

## 🎯 Prediction Market Details

### Standard In-Room Prediction
**Use Case:** "Will I get the legendary drop this run?"

**Flow:**
1. Streamer creates prediction (sets question + duration)
2. Viewers bet YES or NO
3. Optimistic Oracle resolves (5-min challenge window)
4. Winners claim share of losing pool

**Economics:**
```
Total Pool: $100
YES Pool: $60
NO Pool: $40
Outcome: YES

Winners (YES bettors) get:
- Principal back: $60
- Share of losing pool: $40 × 0.95 = $38
Total: $98 (split pro-rata)

Platform earns: $40 × 0.05 = $2
```

---

### Stream Futures (v2)
**Use Case:** "Will streamer X reach 10K followers by Dec 2025?"

**Flow:**
1. Anyone can create a long-term prediction
2. Liquidity accumulates over weeks/months
3. Settlement on target date
4. Platform takes smaller cut (3%) due to higher volume

**Why It Works:**
- Creates "investment thesis" around streamers
- Longer timeframes = more participants
- Natural discovery mechanism (trending futures = trending streamers)

---

### Rage Quit Insurance (v2)
**Use Case:** "Will streamer rage quit within 10 minutes?"

**Flow:**
1. Viewers bet on tilt likelihood
2. Short time window (5-15 min)
3. If rage quit happens, YES wins
4. If not, pool goes to streamer as "tilt tax"

**Why It's Fun:**
- Turns frustration into revenue
- Encourages spicy, high-emotion content
- Fast-paced gambling mechanics

**Economics:**
```
If NO wins (streamer stays calm):
- Streamer gets 95% of YES pool (rewarded for composure)
- Platform gets 5%
- This reduces streamer incentive to fake rage quit
```

## 🎁 Bootstrapping Incentives

### Points-Based Rewards (Instead of Token Airdrops)
Since we don't have a token yet, all early activity earns **Points**:

#### Viewer Quest System
- Watch first stream → 100 points
- Tip a streamer → 50 points
- Win a prediction → 100 points
- Join 5 different rooms → 200 points

#### Points Multipliers
- **Streaming:** 10 points/minute
- **Watching:** 1 point/minute
- **Tipping (sent):** 2 points per SUI
- **Tipping (received):** 5 points per SUI
- **Prediction Bets:** 3 points per SUI bet
- **Prediction Wins:** 50 bonus points

### Token Launch (End of Phase 2)
When the native token launches:
```
User's Token Allocation = (User Points / Total Points) × Airdrop Pool
```

**Example:**
- Total Points: 10M
- Airdrop Pool: 10M tokens (10% of supply)
- User with 100K points = 1% of airdrop = 100K tokens

### Zero Platform Fees (Phase 1)
- 0% on tips during first 3 months
- Builds loyalty before introducing fees

## 🎯 Tai Moat

### What We Offer That Twitch Can't:
1. **Prediction Markets:** Regulated gambling laws prevent Twitch from doing this
2. **Equity NFTs:** Viewers become stakeholders (securities law nightmare for Web2)
3. **Micropayments:** Every viewer generates revenue, not just subscribers
4. **Transparent Economics:** All revenue on-chain, no shadow-banning

### What We Offer That Kick Can't:
1. **Sustainable Economics:** Not VC-subsidized (they're burning cash)
2. **Community Ownership:** Viewers and streamers own the platform
3. **Advanced Primitives:** Smart contract capabilities beyond simple payments

---

## 📈 Long-Term Vision

By Year 3, platform revenue comes from:
- **40%** Micropayments (volume game)
- **30%** Ads (traditional model)
- **20%** Predictions + Futures (engagement)
- **10%** NFTs, Bounties, Other (experimental)

**Key Insight:** We start with high-touch features (predictions) to bootstrap, then migrate to low-touch, high-volume features (micropayments) as we scale.
